version 1 contains the full calculator for all four forces including the high energy environment simulation.
version 2 expands how much data is gathered before plotting and does not contain the fundamental forces calculator

The program simulates the four fundamental forces—gravity, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear—at high energy levels. It randomly adjusts things like energy levels, pulse amplitude, and frequency at each step of the simulation. The idea is to show how these forces interact and change over time, and then combine them into a unified force.
The part of the equation with (1 + t²) makes the forces weaker as time goes on, which shows how things like energy dissipate over time.
So, this program gives a way to simulate how the forces might interact and combine in a high-energy system. It’s simplified but gives a sense of how things like energy levels, frequency, and time impact the forces we see in the universe.
